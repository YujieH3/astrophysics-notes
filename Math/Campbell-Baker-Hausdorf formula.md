For non-commutative $X,Y$,
$$
\exp(X)\exp(Y)=\exp\left( X + Y + \frac{1}{2}[X,Y] + \frac{1}{12}[X,[X,Y]]+\frac{1}{12}[Y,[Y,X]] + \cdots\right)
$$
Its dual is called the the Zassenhaus formula, which is equally (some might say more) useful in Quantum Field Theory,
$$
\exp(X + Y) = \exp(X)\exp(Y)\exp(\frac{1}{2}[X,Y]) \cdots
$$
or in a simpler form
$$
\exp(X+Y) = \exp(X)\exp(Y)\prod_{n=2}^\infty\exp(C_n(X,Y))
$$
where $C_n(X,Y)$ are polynomials in $X,Y$ of degree $n$.
