*The wikipedia page for [vector space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space) is good enough so I used the definition there*

A vector space over a field $F$ is a non-empty set $V$ together with a binary operation and a binary function that satisfy the eight axioms listed below. 
- The binary operation, called vector addition or simply addition assigns to any two vectors $v$ and $w$ in $V$ a third vector in $V$ which is commonly written as $v + w$, and called the sum of these two vectors.
- The binary function, called scalar multiplication, assigns to any scalar $a$ in $F$ and any vector $v$ in $V$ another vector in $V$, which is denoted $av$.
