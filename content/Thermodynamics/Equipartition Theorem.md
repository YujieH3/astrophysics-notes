The equipartition theorem shows that in thermal equilibrium, any degree of freedom (such as a component of the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of $1/2k_B T$ and therefore contributes $1/2k_B$ to the system's heat capacity. This has many applications.

It follows that in thermal equilibrium, monatomic gas has an average energy $u=3/2k_BT$ per particle. Monatomic gas has degree of freedom $f=3$. An diatomic gas with $u = 5/2k_BT$ for they have $f=5$.

A note on the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ and ideal gas constant $R$. $k_B$ is a microscopic quantity, corresponds to number of particle while $R$ is macroscopic, counting particles in mole.
$$
R = k_BN_A.

For a blob of ideal gas,
$$
E = \frac{3}{2}Nk_BT = \frac{3}{2}nRT.
