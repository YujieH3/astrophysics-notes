The equipartition theorem shows that in thermal equilibrium, any degree of freedom (such as a component of the position or velocity of a particle) which appears only quadratically in the energy has an average energy of $1/2k_B T$ and therefore contributes $1/2k_B$ to the system's heat capacity. This has many applications.

It follows that in thermal equilibrium, monatomic gas has an average energy $\varepsilon=3/2k_BT$ per particle. Monatomic gas has degree of freedom $f=3$. An diatomic gas with $\varepsilon = 5/2k_BT$ for they have $f=5$. $\varepsilon$ here is average energy per particle.

A note on the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ and ideal gas constant $R$. $k_B$ is a microscopic quantity, corresponds to number of particle while $R$ is macroscopic, counting particles in mole.
$$
R = k_BN_A.
$$
For a blob of ideal gas, the total internal energy (kinetic energy without bulk movement energy, and no rest mass energy, so not the total energy of the gas) is
$$
E = \frac{3}{2}Nk_BT = \frac{3}{2}nRT.
$$
Note that this equation is valid only under **nonrelativistic ideal monatomic gas in its rest frame**, and does not generalize.

- Note: relation with the adiabatic index $\gamma$. For monatomic gas $\gamma=5/3$ restores the factor of $3 /2$
$$
\varepsilon = \frac{1}{\gamma - 1} k_BT
$$
- Internal energy per unit mass $u$
$$
u = \frac{k_BT}{(\gamma-1)\mu m_H}
$$
##### Derivation
Integrating the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
$$
E = \int_0^{\infty} \frac{d^3k}{(2\pi)^3} E(k)e^{-\frac{E(k)}{k_BT}}
$$
where $E(k)=\frac{k^2}{2m}$ is the kinetic energy.
