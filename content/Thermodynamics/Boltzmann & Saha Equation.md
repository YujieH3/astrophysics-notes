## Boltzmann Equation
Under Thermodynamic Equilibrium, for two energy state of an atom, Bolzmann equation gives the ratio of their number density according to temperature and their energy difference.
$$
\frac{N_k}{N_i} = \frac{g_k}{g_i}e^{-\frac{\varepsilon_k - \varepsilon_i}{kT}}
$$

## Saha Equation
By extending Boltzmann equation into continuous states, Saha equation give the ratio of number density of atoms on two adjacent ionization levels.
$$
\frac{N_{r+1}}{N_r}P_e = \mathrm{Kr}(T) = \frac{2u_1(T)}{u_0(T)}\frac{(2\pi m_e)^{3/2}(kT)^{5/2}}{h^3}e^{-\frac{\chi_r}{kT}}
$$
Where $u$ is the partition function
$$
u_r(T) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty g_{r,i} e^{-\frac{e_{r,i}}{kT}}
$$
