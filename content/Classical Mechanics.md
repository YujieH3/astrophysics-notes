### Stationary-action Principle
For action $S = \int L(q(t), \dot q(t), t)dt$, the path taken by the system between times $t_1$ and $t_2$ and configurations $q_1$ and $q_2$ is the one for which the **action** is **stationary (no change)** to **first order**. For many systems, the Lagrangian is $T-V$.

The mathematical expression is
$$
\delta S = 0
$$
Euler-Lagrangian equation gives the equation of motion
$$
\frac{d}{d\tau}\left(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \dot t}\right) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0
$$

Similarly the Euler-Lagrangian equation for fields $\phi^a(x^\mu)$ (a bunch of fields, hence the subscript) is
$$
\partial_\mu \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial\, \partial_\mu\phi^a} - \frac{\partial\mathcal L}{\partial \phi^a} = 0
$$
