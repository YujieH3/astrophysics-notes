[[LCDM Model]]
Definition
$$H_0 := \frac{\dot a_0}{a_0} = H(0)$$
and as a function of redshift
$$H(z) = \frac{\dot a(z)}{a(z)}$$
- Peculiar velocity $v_p\sim \frac{1}{a}$. See e.g. https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Watson/Watson2_2_1.html

### Hubble parameter h
https://www.astro.ljmu.ac.uk/~ikb/research/h-units.html

While a lot of cosmology quantities are dependent (not physically, could be just $H_0$ is used in the deduction) on hubble parameter, the precise value of Hubble constant are not decided yet. Therefore 2 common approach is, one, taking a fiducial value ($h=0.7$ for example), or, embedding dimensionless parameter $h$ into the unit.

$h$ is defined as
$$
H_0 = h \cdot 100\mathrm{\,km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}
$$
