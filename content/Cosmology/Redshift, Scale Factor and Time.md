[[Cosmology Standard Model]]
The universe evolve from $a(t)=0$ to $a(t) = a_0 = 1$ now, from $z=\infty$ to $z=0$.
Redshift is defined as
$$1 + z := \frac{a_0}{a(t)}$$
## Redshift and Time
$$t(z) = \int_0^\infty \frac{dz}{H(z)(1+z)}$$
Where according to the [[Cosmology Standard Model]], $H(z)$ can be expressed in terms of the cosmological parameters (density of different components).

For a simple universe dominated by matter, vacuum, and curvature (neglectable amount of relativistic matter / radiation).
$$H(z) = H_0\sqrt{\Omega_{m0}(1+z)^3 + \Omega_{\Lambda0} + \Omega_{k0}(1+z)^2}$$

Some cosmology calculators: calculate time etc. according to cosmology parameters.

## Cosmic Timeline
![[Reionization-timeline.jpg]]

After the cosmic microwave background formed 400,000 years after the Big Bang, all the Universe's hydrogen gas was in atomic form: an electron orbiting each proton. But this did not last: massive stars produce enough energy to tear apart, or ionize, hydrogen, separating protons and electrons. When galaxies grew in the first billion years, light from their hot stars spread into the surrounding intergalactic gas, producing bubbles of ionized gas around them. As galaxies continued to grow, so did the ionized bubbles â€“ reionizing all hydrogen. This is the landmark event of the first generations of galaxies, marking the transition from the Cosmic Dawn to the later evolution of "normal" galaxies.
