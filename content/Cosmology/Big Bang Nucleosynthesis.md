## Conservation of entropy

>[!Hannu's Cosmology II (2022), p84]
>According to the second law of thermodynamics the total entropy of the universe never decreases; it either stays constant or increases. An increase in entropy is always related to a deviation from thermodynamic equilibrium. It turns out that any entropy production in the various known processes in the universe is totally insignificant compared to the total entropy of the universe56, which is huge, and dominated by the relativistic species. Thus it is an excellent approximation to treat the expansion of the universe as adiabatic, so that the total entropy stays constant, i.e.
>$$d(sa^3) = 0$$
