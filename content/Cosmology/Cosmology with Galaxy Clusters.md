#### Cluster Properties

**X-ray Luminosity** (from images or spectra) depends strongly on $\rho$, more weakly on $T$. Bremsstrahlung emission from hot ionized gas.

Emissivity of a bremsstrahlung-emitting plasma is
$$
\epsilon_\nu \propto \frac{Z^2n_en_i}{T^{1/2}}e^{-h\nu/kT}
$$
$\epsilon_\nu$ is energy emitted per unit frequency, time and volume. $n_e, n_i$ are number densities of electrons and ions. $Z$ is charge on ion. Then
$$
L_X \propto \int \epsilon_\nu d\nu dV \propto \int n_en_i T^{1/2}dV \sim \rho^2
$$

**X-ray Temperature** $kT$ (from spectra) - Fitting to observed X-ray spectra give temperature of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). $kT$ in range $\sim 1$ to $\sim 15$ keV. Gas are heated to these temperatures during cluster formation. $kT \sim \langle T \rangle$ (kinetic energy) -virial theorem-> cluster mass.

**Metal abundances in ICM** (from spectra)

**Density of ICM** (from surface brightness profile)

**Overdensity Radii** $R_\Delta$ - A radius within which the mean density is $\Delta$ times the critical density ($\rho_c$) at the cluster's redshift. Denoted as $R_\Delta$. And the total mass within $R_\Delta$ is denoted as $M_\Delta = \Delta\rho_c \dfrac{4\pi}{3}R_\Delta^3$. Recall from [[Cosmology Standard Model]], $\rho_c := \dfrac{3H(z)^2}{8\pi G}$. 

Simulations show $R_{200} \sim$ virial radius: radius separating relaxed part of cluster from infalling material. $R_{500} \, (\sim 0.5 R_{200})$ is radius measured out to in typical X-ray observations. 

If a galaxy cluster is **dynamically relaxed** (no recent mergers) we expect the gas and galaxies to be virialized ([[Virial Theorem]]). 


#### Scaling Relations
Self-similar model assumes: 
- Clusters form in single collapse at $z_{obs}$
- Gravity only source of energy
Self-similar model predicts:  
- Clusters of different masses are scaled versions 
- Clusters at different $z$ identical if scaled for $\rho_c(z)$
