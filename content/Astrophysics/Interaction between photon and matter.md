# List of possible interaction between photon and matter

- **Thomson Scattering**: Elastic scattering of photons by free electrons (low-energy photons, non-relativistic electrons).
- **Compton Scattering**: Inelastic scattering of photons by free electrons (relativistic regime, photon loses energy).
- **Rayleigh Scattering**: Elastic scattering by bound electrons (low-energy photons, wavelength comparable to particle size).
- **Mie Scattering**: Scattering by larger particles (e.g., dust or droplets).

- **Photoionization (Bound-Free Absorption)**: Photon removes an electron from an atom or ion. (photoelectric effect is a kind of photoionization)
- **Bound-Bound Absorption**: Photon excites an electron to a higher energy level within the atom.
- **Free-Free Absorption**: Photon is absorbed by a free electron in the presence of an ion (bremsstrahlung in reverse).

- **Spontaneous Emission**: Atom emits a photon as an electron transitions to a lower energy state.
- **Stimulated Emission**: Incident photon induces an atom to emit another photon of the same energy and phase.

- A high-energy photon interacts with a nucleus or particle to produce an electron-positron pair (\( \gamma \rightarrow e^- + e^+ \)).

- At very high energies, photons can interact indirectly via quantum processes (e.g., pair production in the presence of other photons).

- Absorption of a photon followed by re-emission at the same or different energy (e.g., Lyman-\( \alpha \) transitions).

- Extremely high-energy photons interact with atomic nuclei, causing reactions like photodisintegration.
