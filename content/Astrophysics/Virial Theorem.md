The Virial theorem is of vital importance in astronomy and astrophysics.

For a stable system of discrete particles, bound by a conservative force (forces characterized exclusively by their work), with that of the total potential energy of the system. Mathematically, the theorem states
$$
\langle T \rangle = -\frac{1}{2}\langle \vec{F}_k \cdot \vec r_k\rangle
$$

If the force between any two particles of the system results from a potential energy $V(r) = \alpha r^n$ that is proportional to some power n of the interparticle distance $r$, the virial theorem takes the simple form
$$
2\langle T\rangle = n\langle V \rangle
$$

For gravity $V(r) = -GMm/r \sim r^{-1}$, the virial theorem for gravitational bounded system is
$$\boxed{2\langle T \rangle = - \langle V\rangle}$$
This is often written as
$$
\langle T\rangle = -\frac{1}{2} \langle V \rangle
$$
For a gravitationally bound test particle
$$
\frac{1}{2}v^2 = -\frac{1}{2}\cdot -\frac{GM}{R} = \frac{1}{2} \frac{GM}{R}
$$
### Virial temperature
$$T_\text{vir} = \frac{GM}{3kR}$$
For a system of mass $M$ and radius $R$ with constant density, the gravitational energy per unit mass is $W = GM/R$. The kinetic energy per unit mass is $E = (3/2)kT_\text{vir}/μ$
$$
\begin{align}
2K + U = 0\\
2 \times \frac{3}{2}kT/\mu + \frac{GM}{R} = 0
\end{align}
$$

### Virialization

The formation of a dynamic equilibrium in a system of collisionless particles modelled as being subject only to Newtonian gravity (galaxy, other stellar system, or galaxy cluster).
