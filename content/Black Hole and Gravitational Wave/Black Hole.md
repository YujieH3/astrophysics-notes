| Intermediate-mass BH | $10^3\,M_\odot$ | $10^3\,\text{km}\sim R_\text{Earth}$ |
| Stellar BH | $10\,M_\odot$ | $30\,\text{km}$ |
| Micro BH | up to $\,M_\text{Moon}$ | up to $0.1\,\text{mm}$ |

### The three hairs
While the mass of a black hole can take any positive value, the charge and angular momentum are constrained by the mass. The total electric charge _Q_ and the total angular momentum _J_ are expected to satisfy the inequality
$$\frac{Q^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} + \frac{c^2J^2}{GM^2} \leq GM^2$$

the dimensionless *spin parameter* can be defined as $a = cJ/GM^2$
$$0 \leq \frac{cJ}{GM^2} \leq 1.$$
there is also $a=J/Mc\in[0, GM/c^2]$ called *Kerr parameter* or angular parameter per unit mass, which, in geometrical units, is in $[0, M]$.


## Black hole thermodynamics
1. Surface gravity $K$ is a constant everywhere on event horizon.
2. Compare 2 black hole that differ only in $M$, $J$,
$$
\delta M = \frac{K}{8\pi G}\delta A + \Omega_H \delta J
$$
$\Omega_H$ is the surface angular momentum, $A$ is the surface area $=4\pi R_H^2$. An analogy with $\delta Q = TdS$...?
2. $\delta A < 0$.
3. Impossible to reduce $\kappa\rightarrow 0$ in a finite number of steps.
$$
S = \frac{k_B A_Hc^3}{4\pi\hbar}
$$
