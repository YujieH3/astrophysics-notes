## Dirac equation
$$
\boxed{\left(i\gamma^\mu\frac{\partial}{\partial x^\mu} - m\right)\psi = 0}
$$
## Gamma matrices
relativistic S equation -> spin!

Plane wave solution
Feynman slash notation $\cancel{P} = P_{\mu}\gamma^{\mu}$
Commute with Hamiltonian -> conserved quantity / observable

helicity & chirality. 
In massless case helicity and chirality either coincide or interchange.
In massive case chirality is not an observable $[\gamma_5, \hat H]=-2m\gamma_0\gamma_5$. (helicity always is, $[\hat h, \hat H] = 0$)
We interpret helicity with chirality, helicity itself is algebraic.

4 degrees of freedom, +- energy, +- helicity/chirality

but what is - energy solution?

EM field

gauge invariance - (you can at most say A is pure gauge, but not zero) 
generalized momentum $P=\partial L/\partial q \rightarrow p_\mu + A_\mu$   
Dirac Hamiltonian -> can do perturbation theory

if there is negative energy states, then vacuum is unstable

"Representation" - basis
For - E solution -> C -> build + E solution
$$\psi \rightarrow C\psi^*$$
What does it mean? -> change the charge!

Dirac sea? -> positron + electron pair! if enough energy

where mathematics were not rigorous

Quantization of EM field
E, B -> 6 - 2 ($A_\mu$ Bianchi identity) - 1 ($A_0=0$) - 1 ($\nabla\cdot A=0$) 
= 2 degrees of freedom ~ 2 polarization
EOM -> of time

continuous limit: large volume, small spacing
-> creation / annihilation operator

Quantum harmonic oscillator * N -> QFT

Particles is an intrinsic feature of perturbation theory (eigenvectors of free Hamiltonian), which makes the perturbation theory fundamental.
