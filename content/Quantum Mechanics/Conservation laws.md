If under a unitary transformation the Hamiltonian is invariant
$$
UHU^\dagger = H \leftrightarrow [U,H]=0 
$$
it also follows that the observable corresponding to the Hermitian operator $A$ is conserved
$$
\frac{dA}{dt} = [A, H] = 0
$$
where $U = e^{iA}$. Recall that any [[Unitary transformation]] $U$ can be written with a [[Hermitian operator]] $A$.
