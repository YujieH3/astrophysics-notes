A semiclassical quantization, discovered before the Schr√∂dinger equation. For periodic motion, phase accumulated in one period should be an integer multiple of $2\pi$
$$
\frac{1}{\hbar}\oint p dx + \gamma = 2\pi n,\quad n=0,1,2,...
$$
- $p = mv + qA$ the canonical momentum (not an operator!)
- $\gamma$ is a phase shift picked up at two turning points, $\gamma = \pm \pi$ at a hard wall (e.g. infinite potential well), $\gamma=-\pi/2$ at a smooth turning point.
