Operator $\hat{U}$ is an unitary operator if 
$$\hat{U}^\dagger \hat{U} = \hat{U}\hat{U}^\dagger = \hat{1}$$
or equivalently $\hat{U}^{-1} = \hat{U}^\dagger$. Every unitary operator on a Hilbert space can be written as $\hat{U} = e^{i\hat{A}}$ where $\hat{A}$ is a [[Hermitian operator]].

For a transformation, the state vectors change as $|\chi\rangle\rightarrow |\chi'\rangle = \hat{U}|\chi\rangle$, operators $\hat{O} \rightarrow \hat{O}'=\hat{U}\hat{O}\hat{U}^{\dagger}$
$$
\langle\phi|\hat{O}|\chi\rangle = \langle\phi'|\hat{U}\hat{O}\hat{U}^\dagger|\chi'\rangle = \langle\phi'|\hat{O}'|\chi'\rangle
$$
the norm is preserved upon unitary transformation
