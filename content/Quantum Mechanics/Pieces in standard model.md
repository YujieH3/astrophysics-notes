## Conservation laws
Antimatter counts as negative baryon/lepton number
- Baryon number is always conserved.
- (Electric) charge is always conserved.
- Lepton number is always conserved. (separately for $e,\mu,\tau$)
- Mass on the left hand side of the equation must be bigger than the mass on the right hand side. (Conservation of energy)
- Strangeness may be conserved, but not always. (In weak interactions it can change by 1)
- The angular momentum is conserved

## Note in counting degree of freedoms
1. For massive particles $g = 2s+1$, massless ones $g=2s$. 
2. Which is why photons have 2 polarizations instead of 3. So do gluons.
3. Neutrinos only have one polarization for each type (6 in total). 
4. Particles with charges have antiparticles.
5. Neutrons have antineutrions.
6. Neutrions have antineutrons.
