Adiabatic evolution with return to starting point, final state can only differ from initial state by a phase factor (for a non-degenerate state)
$$
\psi_f = e^{i\gamma_B}\exp\left(-\frac{i}{h} \int_0^TE(t)dt \right)\psi_i
$$
There are two phase factors, one is a dynamical phase factor, depending on the period $T$ of the cycle. The other is called Berry phase, or geometric phase, independent on $T$,
$$
\gamma_B = i\oint\langle\alpha| \frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha} |\alpha\rangle d\alpha
$$
where $\alpha$ is the parameter given by $H[\alpha(t)]|\alpha(t)\rangle = E(t)|\alpha(t)\rangle$.
