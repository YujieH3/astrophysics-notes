*"What I cannot create, I do not understand."*  -- Richard Feynman

The purpose of this website, these notes, are not to serve as an encyclopedia. But as a personal reminder to keep track of the understanding that I have on these materials. I often find myself doing the work that I once did, learning the things that I once learned, and get stuck on the problems that I once solved. This website will help keep track of those concepts, tricks, and insights, bit by bit.

Update Feb 16, 2025. I am not alone in this! :D

By Oct 2024, I'm starting a project to study a new set of multifield inflation solution attractors, focusing on the mathematical structure as well as the observational evidences. You are welcomed to check under the cosmology folder for some of my notes on this topic.

This website is created using Obsidian and Flowershow.
