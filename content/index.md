The purpose of this website, these notes, are not to serve as an encyclopedia. But as a personal reminder to keep track of the understanding that I have on these materials. I often find myself doing the work that I once did, learning the things that I once learned, and get stuck on the problems that I once solved. This website will help keep track of those concepts, tricks, and insights. As a result these notes will not be prone to errors, probably more so than most of the materials you read elsewhere. And besides myself, I hope that these notes can help more people as it becomes more and more complete and reader-friendly in the future.
