*"What I cannot create, I do not understand."*  -- Richard Feynman

The purpose of this website, these notes, are not to serve as an encyclopedia. But as a personal reminder to keep track of the understanding that I have on these materials. I often find myself doing the work that I once did, learning the things that I once learned, and get stuck on the problems that I once solved. This website will help keep track of those concepts, tricks, and insights, bit by bit.

The importance of note taking cannot be understated
