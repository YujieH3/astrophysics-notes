*"What I cannot create, I do not understand."*  -- Richard Feynman

The purpose of this website, these notes, are not to serve as an encyclopedia. But as a personal reminder to keep track of the understanding that I have on these materials. I often find myself doing the work that I once did, learning the things that I once learned, and get stuck on the problems that I once solved. This website will help keep track of those concepts, tricks, and insights. As a result these notes will be prone to errors, probably more so than most of the materials you read elsewhere. 

I hope that these notes can help more people besides myself as it becomes more complete and reader-friendly in the future, that vision, of course, takes a lot more work to realize.

By Oct 2024, I'm starting a project to study a new set of multifield inflation solution attractors, focusing on the mathematical structure as well as the observational evidences. You are welcomed to check under the cosmology folder for some of my notes on this topic.
