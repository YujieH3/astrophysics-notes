Four-velocity is a tangent to the trajectory (4-velocity is ill-defined for photons, because $d\tau^2=-ds^2 = 0$)
$$
U^\mu := \frac{dx^\mu}{d\tau}
$$
By definition
$$
U_{\mu}U^{\mu} = -1
$$

#### [Four-momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-momentum), and the energy momentum relation
for object with mass
$$
p^\mu=mU^\mu=(E, \vec p)
$$
By definition
$$p_\mu p^{\mu} = -m^2$$

For a photon
$$
p^\mu := \frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda} \rightarrow (\hbar\omega, \hbar \vec k)
$$

(recall definition of $\omega$ and $\vec k$, $|k|/\omega = c$)
