$$
E^2 = \vec{p}^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4
$$
Or
$$
0=p_{\mu}p^\mu + m^2c^2,\quad (-,+,+,+)
$$
$$
0=p_{\mu}p^\mu - m^2c^2,\quad (+,-,-,-)
$$

We denote the spatial 3-momentum as $\vec{p}$ and 4-momentum $p^\mu$, just to avoid confusion. Different literature may have different definition. 

## Other forms
In geometrical units, $c=1$,
$$
E^2 = \vec{p}^2 + m^2
$$
Or
$$
0=p_{\mu}p^\mu + m^2,\quad (-,+,+,+)
$$
$$
0=p_{\mu}p^\mu - m^2,\quad (+,-,-,-)
$$
It is also called the *on-shell* condition in QFT
$$
p_\mu p^\mu = -m^2,\quad (-,+,+,+)
$$
$$
p_\mu p^\mu = m^2,\quad (+,-,-,-)
$$
