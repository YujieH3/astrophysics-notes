The [YouTube series by Mathemaniac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRca3Ggpy_g) are very good.

A Lie group is a group (the 4 axioms) and also a manifold -> Lie algebra

For any continuous group, the transformations that lie infinitesimally close to the identity define a vector space, called the *Lie algebra* of the group. The basis vectors for this vector space are called the *generators* of the Lie algebra, or of the group. 

It is generally true that one can find matrix representations of a continuous group by finding matrix representations of the generators of the group (which must satisfy the proper commutation relations), then exponentiating these infinitesimal transformations. (3.1, Peskin & Schroeder)

Rotation generators $J^i$, which satisfy the commutation relations $[J^i, J^j] = i\epsilon^{ijk}J^k$. Finite rotation operations are therefore $R = \exp[-i\theta^iJ^i]$. In two dimension matrix representation is $U = e^-i\theta^i\sigma^i/2$.

#### SU(2) Lie Space

Space with basis of matrx basis $\in SU(2)$ , for example, Pauli matrices.
