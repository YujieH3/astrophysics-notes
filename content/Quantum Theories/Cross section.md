Cross-section in $2\rightarrow 2$ reactions
$$
\sigma \sim \int \frac{d^3k}{(2E_k)(2\pi)^3} \frac{d^3k'}{(2 E_{k'})(2\pi)^3} |\mathcal{M}|^2\delta^4(\sum_\text{in}p - \sum_\text{out}k)
$$
where $|\mathcal{M}|^2$ is a matrix element - probability of scattering - for a particular choice of incoming and outgoing momenta $p_\text{in}$ and $k_\text{out}$.

- Cross-section can depend only on Lorentz invariant quantities. e.g. masses of particles, coupling constants, centre of mass energy $s = (p+p')^2 = (k+k')^2=4E_\text{cm}^2$.
- If all incoming particles are relativisitic, $E\gg m$, we expect that total cross section is a function of center-of-mass energy only.
