Dark Matter vs Modified Gravity
Stacy S. McGaugh et al. PRL 2016 -> modified gravity?

Dark matter: lots of work, but null result
Dark energy: not much work, getting active recently
Far from solving the problem

### Gravitational Wave Cosmology
cold dark matter: zero temperature -> infinite hierarchical to small scale
but observation observed a 'lower bound', where no halo lower than that mass is found -> maybe there is none, maybe they are not with galaxies
Gravitational wave cosmology might be able to solve this
