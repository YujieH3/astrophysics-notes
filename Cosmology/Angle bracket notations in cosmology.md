The meaning of angle brackets $\langle \cdot \rangle$ often depends on the context. It generally means the *expectation value* or *ensemble average* over different *realizations*. It could mean one of the following
1. The average quantity $\cdot$ of different realization of the universe under same cosmology
2. When ergodicity is assumed, $\langle\cdot\rangle = \bar\cdot = \frac{1}{V} \int \cdot\,d^3 x$
3. When $\cdot$ is promoted to a (set of) quantum operator, the expectation value follows with the  $\langle \cdot \rangle \equiv \langle 0 |\cdot| 0 \rangle$
