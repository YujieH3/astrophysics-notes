## Coulomb's Law
In SI units
$$
F = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} \quad(SI)
$$
Most advanced work is done in the Gaussian system, in which charge is measured in electrostatic units (esu)
$$
F = \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2} \quad(G)
$$
Elementary particle physicists prefer the Heaviside-Lorentz system
$$
F = \frac{1}{4\pi} \frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}\quad (HL)
$$
The 3 units of charge are related as follows:
$$
q_{HL} = \sqrt{4\pi} q_G = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_0}}q_{SI}
$$
