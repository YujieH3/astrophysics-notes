## First Law of Thermodynamics
Differential Form, for system in quasistatic process
$$
dU = TdS - PdV + \sum_i \mu_i dN_i
$$
Specific Heat
$$
c_P := \left.\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T}\right|_P,\quad c_V := \left.\frac{\partial Q}{\partial T}\right|_V = \frac{dU}{dT}
$$

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
Entropy
$$dS := \frac{dQ}{T}$$
When a closed thermodynamic system goes from equilibrium state 1 to equilibrium state 2, the entropies of these two states obeys the relation
$$S_2 - S_1 \geq \int_1^2\frac{d Q}{T}$$
