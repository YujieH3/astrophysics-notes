#### Wave function and Dirac braket
Wave functions and Dirac braket are entirely a difference in notation, more so than the Schrödinger and Heisenberg pictures. The correspondence between the wave function and braket is as follows,
$$
\text{wave function } \psi(x) = \langle x|\alpha\rangle
$$
By introducing a Hilbert space and regard wave functions as components of vectors, the possibilities other than position $\psi(x)$ and momentum $\Psi(p)$ representations are opened. 

Sometimes we write $|\psi(t)\rangle$, this refers to the vector state represented by the wave function
$$
|\psi(t)\rangle = \int dx\,|x\rangle\langle x|\psi(t)\rangle = \int dx\,|x\rangle\psi(t)
$$
Don't be confused by $|\psi(t)\rangle$. When we write it inside a ket, $|\psi(t)\rangle$ is no longer a wave function, in the same manner that $|x\rangle$ is the position eigen state and $\hat x$ is the position operator -- distinct object with same element in notation.
