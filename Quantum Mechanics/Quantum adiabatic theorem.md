Quantization of adiabatic invariant (Ehrenfest)
$$
J = \oint pdq = nh
$$
no transition between energy levels if the Hamiltonian changes sufficiently slowly, which is that $\hbar \omega = E_{n+1} - E_n \equiv \delta$, and that the rate of change of this gap is small $|\dot\delta| \ll \frac{\delta_\text{min}^2}{\hbar}$. 

The transition breaking this condition is called the Landau-Zener transition,
$$
P_\text{LZ transition} = e^{-\frac{\pi\delta_\text{min}^2}{2\hbar|\dot\delta|}}
$$
we see that $P\ll 1$ if $\hbar |\dot\delta|\ll\delta^2$

- The term adiabatic is often used to mean slow changing, semi-steady state.
