> [[Gravitation#Newton's Theory of Gravitation]] is an example of a dynamical system set within the context of Newtonian mechanics, while Maxwell's electromagnetism is a dynamical system operating within the context of special relativity.

**Spacetime interval** $(ds)^2$ is defined as
$$(ds)^2 = g_{\mu\nu}d x^\mu d x^\nu$$
Geodesics equation
$$\Delta s = \int\sqrt{g_{\mu\nu} \frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda}}d\lambda$$
**Proper time** $\Delta\tau$ is defined as
$$(\Delta \tau)^2 = -(\Delta s)^2 = -g_{\mu\nu}\Delta x^\mu \Delta x^\nu$$
The proper time between two events measures the time elapsed as seen by an observer moving on a straight path between the events. Think of the twin paradox. In space, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line; in spacetime, the longest proper time between two events is a straight trajectory. For trajectory other than straight lines
$$\Delta \tau = \int\sqrt{-g_{\mu\nu} \frac{dx^\mu}{d\lambda}\frac{dx^\nu}{d\lambda}}d\lambda$$
